# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming - Text directions, refs and code

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications
- Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application.
Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program
Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it
Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, referred to as the superclass
Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. For example to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method
Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.

Example of a user class

class User
  attr_accessor :name, :email
  def initialize(name, email)
    @name = name
    @email = email
  end
  def run
    puts "Hey I'm running"
  end
  def self.identify_yourself
    puts "Hey I am a class method"
  end
end
user = User.new("mashrur", "mashrur@example.com")
user.run
User.identify_youself # to run this class method you don't need an instance of user 
# you can directly call the class User 

# Attributes, getters, setters - Text directions, references and code

class Student
  # set up getters & setters
  attr_accessor :first_name, :last_name, :email, :username, :password
  
  # initialized function
  def initialize(firstname, lastname, username, email, password)
    @first_name = firstname
    @last_name = lastname
    @username = username
    @email = email
    @password = password
  end
  
  # override the toString method
  def to_s
    "First name: #{@first_name}, Last name: #{@last_name}, Username: #{@username}, email address: #{@email}"
  end
 
end
 
mashrur = Student.new("Mashrur", "Hossain", "mashrur1", "mashrur@example.com", "password1")
john = Student.new("John", "Doe", "john1", "john1@example.com", "password2")
puts mashrur
puts john
mashrur.last_name = john.last_name
puts "Mashrur is altered"
puts mashrur
